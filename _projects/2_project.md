# Project Overview

This React WebApp interacts with an Arithmetic Calculator REST API. It supports operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Square root
- Random string generation

The backend serves random strings via a webservice provided by Random.Org.

## Security

Security is ensured using JWT tokens generated during user authentication, with credentials securely stored in the backend database's User table.

## Configuration

The application uses an `.env` file for environment-specific settings, with the `VITE_BACKEND_API` variable specifying the backend API URL. For development, it's set to:

- VITE_BACKEND_API= `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ `

## Running the Development Version

1. Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download it.
3. Open terminal and navigate to the folder: `CalculatorReact`
4. Run `npm install`: This will install the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev`: This will run the app.

## Publishing the Production Version

1. Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download it.
3. Open terminal and navigate to the folder: `CalculatorReact`
4. Run `npm install`: This will install the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run build`: This will build the deployable WebApp.
6. Run `npm run preview`: This will run the app from the `dist` folder.

   The generated files for production will be in the `dist` folder. Deploy the contents of this folder to your hosting service.
